# Protect VM Settings with Desired State Configuration
[Azure Learn Materials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/protect-vm-settings-with-dsc/)

## Exercise Overview
In this exercise, you create an Azure Automation account and upload a PowerShell DSC. Then, you onboard an existing VM into Azure Automation. Finally, you check if the VM is missing IIS. If it is, you run code to install and configure IIS on the VM.

## Implementation

### Create a VM
Start by deploying a new VM from a Windows Server 2019 image. In this exercise, we will use the Azure Cloud Shell to create the VM.

1. In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell.
2. Create a resource group for the VM.

    Powershell:
    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name "protect-vms-rg" -Location "West Europe"
    ```
    Bash: 
    
    ```bash
    az group create --name protect-vms-rg --location "West Europe"
    ```
3. Create a username and password for the VM.

    Powershell:
    ```powershell
    $cred = Get-Credential
    ```
    Bash: 
    
    ```bash
    read -p "Enter username: " username
    ```
    ```bash
    read -s -p "Enter password: " password
    ```
4. Create the VM.
    Powershell:
    ```powershell
    New-AzVm  
    -ResourceGroupName "protect-vms-rg"  
    -Name "protect-vms-vm"   
    -Image "win2019datacenter"
    -Credential $cred  
    -OpenPorts 80
    ```
    Bash: 
    
    ```bash
    az vm create \
    --resource-group protect-vms-rg \ 
    --name protect-vms-vm \ 
    --image win2019datacenter \ 
    --admin-username $username \ 
    --admin-password $password
    ```
    ```bash
    az vm open-port 
    --port 80  
    --resource-group protect-vms-rg  
    --name protect-vms-vm
    ```
    It takes a few minutes to create the VM and supporting resources. If the VM is created successfully, you should see output like this:  
    ```json
    {
        "fqdns": "",
        "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/protect-vms-rg/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
        "location": "europewest",
        "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-36-BA-28",
        "powerState": "virtual machine running",
        "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
        "publicIpAddress": "104.40.69.56",
        "resourceGroup": "protect-vms-rg"
    }
    ```
5. Copy the `publicIpAddress` in this output and save it. Later in the exercise, you will use this address to access the VM.
6. In your web browser, go to the public IP address of your VM `http://<publicIpAddress>`. Although port 80 is open, you should see the error message **This site can't be reached**. This error occurs because IIS is not deployed on your VM. We fix that later in this exercise.

### Create an Automation Account
1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. In the search bar, type **Automation** and select **Automation Accounts** from the results.
3. Select **Create** to create a new Automation account.
4. In the **Create Automation Account** window, enter the following values:
    - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.
    - **Resource group**: Select the existing resource group `protect-vms-rg` in the drop-down list.
    - **Name**: Enter a name for the Automation account, such as `protect-vms-aa`.
    - **Region**: Select the region `Europe West`.
5. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create**. Wait for the Automation account to be created.
6. Select **Go to resource** to open the Automation account.

### Create a DSC configuration script
1. In Cloud Shell, if in Bash, switch to PowerShell by entering `pwsh`.
2. Create a new folder for the DSC configuration script.
    ```powershell
    New-Item -Path $HOME -Name "DSC" -ItemType "directory"
    ```
3. Change to the new folder.
    ```powershell
    cd $HOME/DSC
    ```
4. Create a new DSC configuration script.
    ```powershell
    New-Item -Path $HOME/DSC -Name "IISConfig.ps1" -ItemType "file"
    ```
5. Open the script in the Cloud Shell editor.
    ```powershell
    code $HOME/DSC/IISConfig.ps1
    ```
6. Copy the following code into the editor and save the file.
    ```powershell
    Configuration IISConfig {
    Node "localhost" {
        WindowsFeature IIS {
            Ensure = "Present"
            Name = "Web-Server"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
7. Select `Ctrl+S` to save the file to your home directory, and then close the editor `Ctrl+Q`.
8. In your Powershell session in Azure Cloud Shell, enter the following code, replacing `<your-automation-account-name>` with the name of your Automation account.
    ```powershell
    $automationAccountName = "<your-automation-account-name>"
    ```
    To upload the DSC script into your Azure Automation account and compile it, enter the following code:
    ```powershell
    Import-AzAutomationDscConfiguration  
    -ResourceGroupName "protect-vms-rg"  
    -AutomationAccountName $automationAccountName  
    -SourcePath $HOME/DSC/IISConfig.ps1  
    -Published -Force
    ```
    The command should produce output that looks like this:
    ```json
    ResourceGroupName     : [resource group name]
    AutomationAccountName : [your-automation-account-name]
    Location              : eastus
    State                 : Published
    Name                  : MyDscConfiguration
    Tags                  : {}
    CreationTime          : 6/25/21 5:44:36 PM +00:00
    LastModifiedTime      : 6/25/21 5:44:36 PM +00:00
    Description           :
    Parameters            : {}
    LogVerbose            : False
    ```
### Add required modules (optional)
After you upload your DSC configuration script, import any PowerShell modules that the DSC process needs. Our configuration doesn't need any other modules, so we can skip this step. If you needed to import or add modules into your automation account you would go to **Shared Resources**, and then select **Modules** > **Add a module**.

### Compile the DSC script
1. In the Azure portal, open your Automation account.
2. In the left menu, select **State configuration (DSC)** > **Configurations**.
3. Verify that the DSC configuration **IISConfig** script you uploaded is listed. If it is not listed, select **Refresh**.
4. Select the **IISConfig** configuration.
5. Select **Compile** to compile the DSC configuration script.
6. In the **Compile configuration** window, select **Yes**.
7. Check your notifications (notifications icon is in the global controls in the page header). Wait for the compilation job to show **Status** of **Completed**, which may take several minutes.

8. When compliation is complete, close the **IISConfig** panel. Your **State configuration (DSC)** pane appears.

### Register the VM with your Azure Automation account
1. On the **State configuration (DSC)** pane for *[your-automation-account-name]*, select **Nodes**.
In the command bar, select **Add Azure VM**. The **Virtual Machines** pane for your Automation account appears.

4. Enter the following values for each setting.
```
| **Setting**                  | **Value**                                                   |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node configuration name      | From the dropdown list, select MyDscConfiguration.localhost |
| Refresh Frequency            | 30                                                          |
| Configuration Mode Frequency | 15                                                          |
| Configuration Mode           | ApplyAndMonitor                                             |
| Allow Module Override        | Select checkbox                                             |
| Reboot Node if Needed        | Select checkbox                                             |
| Action after Reboot          | ContinueConfiguration                                       |
```

5. Select **OK**.

6. Wait until the VM is connected. This process might take a few minutes. When your **protect-vms-vm** has connected, in the breadcrumb path in the top left of the portal, select your automation account to close the **Registration** and **Virtual Machines pane**. The **State configuration (DSC)** pane for your automation account appears.

7. In the command bar, select **Refresh**.

8. Verify that the node **protect-vms-vm** appears in the list and that its status is **Compliant**.

### Verify that IIS is installed on the VM
In your web browser, go to `http://[public-ip]`, where, `[public-ip]` is the public IP address that you recorded earlier in this exercise.  
You should see the default IIS webpage.
![IIS Default Page](/blog-assets/protect-vm-settings-with-dsc/IISDefaultPage.png)
Congratulations! IIS has been deployed. Azure Automation used the PowerShell DSC script you uploaded to your Azure Automation account.

The following resources were created in this exercise:
![Resource Group](/blog-assets/protect-vm-settings-with-dsc/ResourceGroup.png)

### Clean up resources
1. In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell.
2. Delete the resource group and all resources in it.
    ```powershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "protect-vms-rg" -Force -AsJob
    ```
3. When prompted, enter `Y` to confirm the deletion.
4. Close the Cloud Shell.
