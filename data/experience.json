    "At this position I was fortunate to have built an SQL Transpiler using Java, Bash and a variety of SQL dialects following SOLID design principles. I also worked in teams to deliver products to clients such as the improvement of a REST API service in Python which prices a variety of products based on usage, the support and changes of a .NET risk management application and designed an on-premise to AWS cloud architecture diagram with instances of redshift, greenplum and snowflake to assist a cloud migration process for a client. I have also been present in a multitude of client consultations, stand-up meetings and weekly sprints.",
